## Description

I am a new **software engineer** with a passion for design and system 
architecture. I have recently graduated as a Master of Computer Science at 
[Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca).

## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages, particularly ones that exemplify 
code reuse and DRY and KISS principles. However, I tend to favor compiled 
languages over interpreted ones.

With a fairly thorough background in theoretic computer science, the following 
also have a place near to my heart:

  - Computationally difficult problems and
  - Complex data structures.

Furthermore, operating systems, embedded systems, and language development are 
areas that I wish to pursue further.

From work, I have experience in system modelling and backend development of web 
applications.

*[DRY]: Don't Repeat Yourself
*[KISS]: Keep It Simple Stupid
