### Description

I am a Masters of Computer Science ([M.C.Sci.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science_in_Information_Technology)) student finishing the remainder of my degree at [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca) in [Halifax, Nova Scotia](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Halifax,+NS/), Canada.

### Purpose

This webpage is intended to showcase my current and past projects, as well as to provide a gateway for finding information about me or getting in contact with me.

### Availability

Whenever I am not working, I am capable of putting aside some time for **web development**, **mobile application development**, and **multi-platform programming projects**. I also appreciate a good open source project looking for contributors to contribute to.
