> *Hi -- I'm Alex Safatli*. I've just started building software as a full stack developer.

### Description

I am a recent MCS graduate from [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca) that is passionate about software design and architecture. I am currently working in [Halifax, Nova Scotia](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Halifax,+NS/), Canada as a software developer for a very promising startup company called [watzan](http://watzan.com/).

### Interests

I apparently possess a talent for the construction of web software and system modelling.

With a fairly thorough background in theoretic computer science, the following also have a place near to my heart:

  - Computationally difficult problems and
  - Complex data structures.

Furthermore, operating systems, embedded systems, and language development are areas that I wish to pursue further.
