> *Hi -- I'm Alex Safatli*. I've just started building software as a full stack developer.

## Description

I am a new **software engineer** that is passionate for design and architecture. I graduated from a Master of Computer Science program at [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca) in Fall 2015.

I currently work at a promising startup company in [Halifax, Nova Scotia](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Halifax,+NS/) that is called [watzan, LLC](http://watzan.com/).

## Interests

I possess a talent for system modelling and feature implementation in the backend of scalable systems, such as for those found in web applications.

I enjoy learning new programming languages, particularly ones that exemplify code reuse and DRY and KISS principles, but tend to favor compiled languages over interpreted ones.

With a fairly thorough background in theoretic computer science, the following also have a place near to my heart:

  - Computationally difficult problems and
  - Complex data structures.

Furthermore, operating systems, embedded systems, and language development are areas that I wish to pursue further.

*[DRY]: Don't Repeat Yourself
*[KISS]: Keep It Simple Stupid
