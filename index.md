> *The great use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.* -- William James

### Description

I am a Masters of Computer Science ([M.C.Sci.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science_in_Information_Technology)) graduate student completing the remainder of my degree requirements at [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca) in [Halifax, Nova Scotia](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Halifax,+NS/), Canada.

### Interests

Computationally expensive problems and complex data structures have a place near to my heart. Furthermore, both operating system and language development are areas of computing science that I wish to pursue further, beyond theory and into practical application.

### Availability

Whenever I am not working, I am capable of putting aside some time for **web development**, **mobile application development**, and **multi-platform programming projects**. I also appreciate a good open source project looking for contributors to contribute to.
