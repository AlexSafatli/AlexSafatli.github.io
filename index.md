> *Hi -- I'm Alex Safatli*. I've just started building software as a full stack 
developer.

## Description

I am a new **software engineer** that has a passion for design and system 
architecture. I have recently graduated from a Master of Computer Science 
program at [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca) in Fall 2015.

## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages, particularly ones that exemplify 
code reuse and DRY and KISS principles, but tend to favor compiled languages 
over interpreted ones.

With a fairly thorough background in theoretic computer science, the following 
also have a place near to my heart:

  - Computationally difficult problems and
  - Complex data structures.

Furthermore, operating systems, embedded systems, and language development are 
areas that I wish to pursue further.

At work, I currently focus my efforts on system modelling and feature 
implementation in the backend of a web application.
