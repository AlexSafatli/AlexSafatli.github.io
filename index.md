**I'm a seasoned software engineer and researcher**.

I have a knack for understanding systems quickly and efficiently. I possess a large breadth of knowledge in many areas of computer science and possess a great deal of soft skills ranging from public speaking and publication to strong technical expertise and familiarity with many software stacks. I love combinatorics, system design, computer architecture, logic, and programming languages.
