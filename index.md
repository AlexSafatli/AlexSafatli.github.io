> *The great use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.* -- William James

### Description

Recent graduate from [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca) and passionate about software design and architecture. Currently living in [Halifax, Nova Scotia](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Halifax,+NS/), Canada where I work for an early startup company called [watzan](http://watzan.com/). At watzan, I work on a system to perform personalized digital merchandising using user information obtained from multiple sources.

### Interests

Computationally difficult problems and complex data structures have a place near to my heart. Furthermore, both operating systems, embedded systems, and language development are areas that I wish to pursue further.
