> *[D]oes Aristotle mean that cities as they presently exist, with all their strife and so little justice, are places where we fulfill our nature? Or does he instead mean that it is our nature to live in true cities - cities that do not yet exist, but that we should try to build?* -- Richard Kraut

### Description

I am a Masters of Computer Science ([M.C.Sci.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science_in_Information_Technology)) student finishing the remainder of my degree at [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca) in [Halifax, Nova Scotia](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Halifax,+NS/), Canada.

### Purpose

This webpage is intended to showcase my current and past projects, as well as to provide a gateway for finding information about me or getting in contact with me.

### Availability

Whenever I am not working, I am capable of putting aside some time for **web development**, **mobile application development**, and **multi-platform programming projects**. I also appreciate a good open source project looking for contributors to contribute to.
