## Description

I am a software engineer with a great passion for design and system 
architecture.

## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages, particularly ones that exemplify 
code reuse and DRY and KISS principles.

With a strong background in theoretic computer science, the following 
also have a place near to my heart:

  - Computationally difficult problems and
  - Complex data structures.

Furthermore, operating systems and language development are areas that I 
wish to pursue further.

*[DRY]: Don't Repeat Yourself
*[KISS]: Keep It Simple Stupid
