> *The great use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it.* -- William James

### Description

Master of Computer Science ([MCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science_in_Information_Technology)) graduate student completing the remainder of my degree requirements at [Dalhousie University](http://dal.ca) in [Halifax, Nova Scotia](https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Halifax,+NS/), Canada.

### Interests

Computationally expensive problems and complex data structures have a place near to my heart. Furthermore, both operating system and language development are areas of computing that I wish to pursue further, beyond theory and into practical application.
