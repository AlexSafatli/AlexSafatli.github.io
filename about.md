## I am...

I am studying for a PhD in Computer Science at Dalhousie University.

I enjoy teaching, automating things, and building systems from scratch. I regularly code and participate in a number of projects, both small and large.

Previously, I have...

  - Worked for [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com) in Seattle, WA.
  - Worked for a small number of software companies in Halifax, NS.
  - Acquired a M.S.E. in CS from Dalhousie University.
  - Served as a TA for PPL, Operating Systems, Bioinformatics, Communications, Introduction to Computer Science, and Python.
  - Won several NSERC USRA awards and served as a RA in just as many science labs.

## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages. My favorite all-purpose language is [Go](https://golang.org).

I also have a passion for the following fields of research:

  - First-order logic,
  - System architecture,
  - Succinct data structures, and
  - Language development.
