## I am a...

I am currently studying for a PhD in Computer Science and was previously a software engineer. I possess a M.S.E. in Computer Science from Dalhousie University. I also regularly code and participate in a number of projects, both small and large.

Previously, I have...

  - Worked at [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com) in Seattle, WA.
  - Worked at a small number of software companies in Halifax, NS.
  - Served as a TA for PPL, Operating Systems, Communications and Bioinformatics.
  - Won several NSERC USRA awards and served as a RA in just as many science labs.

## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages. My all-purpose language of choice is [Go](https://golang.org).

With a strong background in theoretic computer science, I also have a passion for the following:

  - Artificial intelligence,
  - First-order logic,
  - System architecture,
  - Language development,
  - Succinct data structures, and
  - Computationally difficult problems.
