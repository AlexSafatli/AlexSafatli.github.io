## Alex is a...

Alex is a software engineer with a master's degree in Computer Science he received in 2015. He currently works as a full-stack developer locally in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. Alex has also had past experience working at the widely-known Amazon in Seattle and regularly involves himself in code outside of work in both small and larger scale projects.

## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages, particularly ones that exemplify code reuse and DRY and KISS principles.

With a strong background in theoretic computer science, the following also have a place near to my heart:

  - Computationally difficult problems,
  - Large-scale system architecture and
  - Complex data structures.

Furthermore, operating systems and language development are areas that I wish to pursue further.
