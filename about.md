## I am...

I am a software engineer who graduated with a M.S.E. in CS and started studies for a PhD in Computer Science at Dalhousie University.

I enjoy teaching. And I absolutely adore automating things and building systems from scratch. I regularly code and participate in [a number of projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects), both small and large.

Previously, I have...

  - Worked for [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com) in Seattle, WA.
  - Worked for a small number of software companies in Halifax, NS.
  - Served as a TA for PPL, Operating Systems, Bioinformatics, Communications, Introduction to Computer Science, and Python.
  - Won several NSERC USRA awards and served as a RA in a handful of chemistry labs.

## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages. My favorite all-purpose language is [Go](https://golang.org) but I am also recently enjoying learning [Haskell](haskell.org).

I am interested in the following fields of computer science:

  - System design,
  - First-order logic,
  - System architecture,
  - Succinct data structures, and
  - Language development.
