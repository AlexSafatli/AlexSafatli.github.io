## I am a...

I'm Alex. I am a software engineer with a M.S.E. in Computer Science. I currently work as a local full-stack developer in my hometown of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. I also regularly do coding and take part in a number of projects outside of work, both small and large.

Previously, I have...

  - Worked at [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com) in Seattle, WA.
  - Served as a TA for PPL, Operating Systems, Communications and Bioinformatics.
  - Won several NSERC USRA awards and served as a RA in just as many science labs.

## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages, particularly ones that exemplify code reuse and DRY and KISS principles.

With a strong background in theoretic computer science, the following also have a place near to my heart:

  - Computationally difficult problems,
  - Large-scale system architecture and
  - Complex data structures.

Furthermore, operating systems and language development are areas that I wish to pursue further.

*[DRY]: Don't Repeat Yourself
*[KISS]: Keep It Simple Stupid
*[TA]: Teaching Assistant
*[RA]: Research Assistant
*[PPL]: Principles of Programming Languages
*[M.S.E.]: Masters of Science and Engineering
*[NSERC]: Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council
*[USRA]: Undergraduate Student Research Award
