## Interests

I enjoy learning new programming languages. My favorite all-purpose language is [Go](https://golang.org) but I am also enjoying learning [Haskell](haskell.org).

I am interested in the following fields of computer science:

  - First-order logic,
  - System architecture,
  - Succinct data structures, and
  - Language development.
