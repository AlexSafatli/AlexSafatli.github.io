## Web-Based Services

My employment at [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com), [BeyondTrust](http://beyondtrust.com) and [watzan](http://watzan.com) had provided me the opportunity to work on relatively real-time, high-demand web applications in areas of e-commerce, enterprise security, retail, health, and media entertainment.
