## Hobby Projects

This is a small selection of projects I have touched and am proud of. Visit my [GitHub](http://github.com/AlexSafatli?tab=repositories) for a more comprehensive list.

### Architecture

  - [os](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/os): An x86 32-bit operating system used to explore concepts of OS and architecture. *C, Assembly*.

### Automation

#### Multimedia

  - [senketsu](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/senketsu): [Plex](https://plex.tv)/[Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) library CLI tool that leverages [Airtable](https://airtable.com/). Written and scaled to help manage terabytes of video files I have at home. Recently rewritten in Go from Python for better performance and control. *Go, Python*.

#### Roleplaying

  - [Saber](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Saber): An engine to provide tooling and algorithm implementation for character, setting, history, and story element generation for tabletop roleplaying games. *Go*.
  - [airtable-dnd](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/airtable-dnd): A CLI tool that leverages [Airtable](https://airtable.com) in order to automate components of play in real-time for an ongoing D&D 5th Edition campaign. 
  - [MeatGrinder](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/MeatGrinder): A web app that automates an element of combat game mechanics present in the GURPS tabletop RPG. Self-hostable using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and created in [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/). *Python*.

### Web

#### Discord

  - [Garrus](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Garrus): A [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot for automation and sound tomfoolery written to be low resource footprint and have minimal basic functionality. *Go*.
  - [NootBot](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/NootBot): The monolithic but mature and functional precursor to *Garrus*. Was hosted and maintained for six years. *Java with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)*.

## Computational Biology

Work arising from research in **computational biology** or bioinformatics.

  - [Pylogeny](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Pylogeny): A peer-reviewed and [journal-published](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-9/) framework for working with discrete combinatorics in [phylogeny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics). *Python*.
  - [ABeRMuSA](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/ABeRMuSA): A CLI utility for three-dimensional protein structure alignment by using a simple pairwise alignment strategy. *Python*.

## Web-Based Services

My employment at [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com), [BeyondTrust](http://beyondtrust.com) and [watzan](http://watzan.com) had provided me the opportunity to work on relatively real-time, high-demand web applications in areas of e-commerce, enterprise security, retail, health, and media entertainment.
