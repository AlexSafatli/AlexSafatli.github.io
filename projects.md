## Web-Based Services

My employment at [watzan, LLC](http://watzan.com) has provided me the 
opportunity to work on a [*Ruby on Rails*](http://rubyonrails.org) 
web [application](https://zen.watzan.com) intended to scale to a large 
number of customers in areas of retail, 
[health](http://health.watzan.com) (conferences), and media 
entertainment.

## Computational Biology

Work arising from Master degree research in **computational biology** or 
bioinformatics.

  - [Pylogeny](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Pylogeny): A peer-reviewed and 
  [journal-published](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-9/) Python framework for 
  working with discrete combinatorics in 
  [phylogeny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics).
  - [ABeRMuSA](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/ABeRMuSA): A Python CL utility 
  for three-dimensional protein structure alignment by using a simple pairwise 
  alignment strategy.

## Hobby Projects

In my free time, I work on some other things. The projects that have seen the 
*most* progress are indicated below. 
[Other projects](http://github.com/AlexSafatli/) are not nearly as fortunate 
but will very likely be revisited in the future.

### Low-Level

  - [os](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/os): An x86 32-bit operating system 
  written to explore concepts of operating systems further than I had been 
  exposed to in my university education.

### Roleplaying

  - [MeatGrinder](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/MeatGrinder): A web-based tool 
  that simplifies an element of game mechanics present in the GURPS tabletop 
  roleplaying game. Hosted using 
  [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) and coded in
  Python.

### Shopping

  - [AutoScraper](http://auto-scraper.heroku.com): A web-based tool that allows 
  local car buyers to find used cars aggregated and collected from multiple 
  local dealerships. Written in Ruby with the *Ruby on Rails* framework as part 
  of a weekend hackathon and extended slightly from there.
