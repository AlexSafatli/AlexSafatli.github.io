## Hobby Projects

In my free time, I work on some of these. A comphrensive list of my projects is at my [GitHub](http://github.com/AlexSafatli?tab=repositories).

### Low-Level

  - [os](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/os): An x86 32-bit operating system (in C and Assembly) to explore concepts of operating systems further than I had been exposed to in university.

### Web-Based

  - [NootBot](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/NootBot): A [Discord](https://discordapp.com) bot for automation and soundboard tomfoolery. A relatively mature project that has been hosted and maintained for years. Coded in Java using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). 

### Productivity

  - [senketsu](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/senketsu): [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/) large media library monitoring and management CLI tool written in Python. I've written and constantly make changes to it to help me manage terabytes of video files I have at home.

### Roleplaying

  - [MeatGrinder](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/MeatGrinder): A web app that simplifies an element of game mechanics present in the GURPS tabletop RPG. Hosted using [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) and coded in Python.

## Computational Biology

Work arising from Master degree research in **computational biology** or bioinformatics.

  - [Pylogeny](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Pylogeny): A peer-reviewed and [journal-published](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-9/) Python framework for working with discrete combinatorics in [phylogeny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics).
  - [ABeRMuSA](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/ABeRMuSA): A Python CL utility for three-dimensional protein structure alignment by using a simple pairwise alignment strategy.

## Web-Based Services

My employment at [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com), [BeyondTrust](http://beyondtrust.com) and [watzan](http://watzan.com) had provided me the opportunity to work on relatively real-time, high-demand web applications in areas of e-commerce, enterprise security, retail, health, and media entertainment.
