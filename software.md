### Code Productivity

Small libraries, scripts, or utilities I have put together to help coding with specialized or general software projects.

  - [TwitchSharp](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/TwitchSharp): A C# API to the REST API for the gaming stream [Twitch.TV](http://twitch.tv) platform.
  - [Subscript](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Subscript): A multi-paradigm object-centric programming language for scripting and interfacing.

### Computational Biology

Projects that came out of work in an area of **computational biology** or bioinformatics during my Master degree research.

  - [Pylogeny](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Pylogeny): A Python framework for working with discrete combinatorics in [phylogeny](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics).
  - [ABeRMuSA](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/ABeRMuSA): A Python CL utility for three-dimensional protein structure alignment by using a simple pairwise alignment strategy.
  - [LabBlouinTools](https://github.com/LabBlouin/LabBlouinTools): Common scripts and libraries for the computational biology laboratory I was a part of.

### Hobby Projects

These projects are small, very specialized projects, for some of my other interests, I have dabbled in and may or may or not have made major progress in.

  - [HearthstoneDrafter](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/HearthstoneDrafter): Project built in Python and with the [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) framework. A small game mode simulator for the Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. game [Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/) that allows the drafting of cards.
  - [EclipseBoardGame](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/EclipseBoardGame): A battle simulator for the [Eclipse](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse) board game written in Python.
