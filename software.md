### Computational Biology

These projects are intended for specific uses in the field of **computational biology**.

  - [Pylogeny](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Pylogeny): A Python framework for the phylogenetic tree landscape, a discrete combinatorial search space.
  - [ABeRMuSA](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/ABeRMuSA): A Python command-line program for the construction of multiple structural alignments of three-dimensional protein structures by using a simple pairwise alignment strategy.
  - [LabBlouinTools](https://github.com/LabBlouin/LabBlouinTools): Contributed majorly to this project of unifying common scripts and libraries for the computational biology laboratory I was a part of.

### Website

This website ([source](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/AlexSafatli.github.io)) has been mostly put together by leveraging the wonderful [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) Ruby web software framework.
