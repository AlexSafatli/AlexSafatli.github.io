### Computational Biology

These projects are intended for specific uses in the field of **computational biology**.

  - [Pylogeny](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/Pylogeny): A Python framework for the phylogenetic tree landscape, a discrete combinatorial search space.
  - [ABeRMuSA](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/ABeRMuSA): A Python command-line program for the construction of multiple structural alignments of three-dimensional protein structures by using a simple pairwise alignment strategy.
  - [LabBlouinTools](https://github.com/LabBlouin/LabBlouinTools): Contributed majorly to this project of unifying common scripts and libraries for the computational biology laboratory I was a part of.

### Code Productivity

Small libraries, scripts, or utilities I have put together to help coding with specialized or general software projects.

  - [TwitchSharp](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/TwitchSharp): A C# API to the REST API for the gaming stream Twitch.TV platform.
  - [App-Icon-Template](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/App-Icon-Template): A package to help create icons for XCode iOS/OS X applications in the open-source Inkscape application. A fork from another project and updated to work with newer iOS 8 standards.

### Hobby Projects

These projects are small, very specialized projects, for some of my other interests, I have dabbled in and may or may or not have made major progress in.

  - [HearthstoneDrafter](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/HearthstoneDrafter): Playing around in Python with the [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) framework and creating a small simulator for the Blizzard Entertainment game Hearthstone&copy;.
  - [EclipseBoardGame](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/EclipseBoardGame): Made a battle simulator for the [Eclipse](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse) board game in Python.

### Website

This website ([source](https://github.com/AlexSafatli/AlexSafatli.github.io)) has been mostly put together by leveraging the wonderful [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) Ruby web software framework.
