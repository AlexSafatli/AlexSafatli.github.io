===================
Summary
===================

An important friend of mine told me that I am someone who strives to create and expand, and the directions I tend to go are ones that others can fail to see. I see this as a virtue, and I consider different avenues in life to be opportunities to create. My objective is to find new directions, to build from there what others would find useful, and, as I do this, to enjoy the different avenues in life.

I am currently a graduate student at Dalhousie University who is in his last term of studies towards a Master of Computer Science. My thesis topic is associated with a problem in the field of biology. Despite this, I see myself not as someone who specializes in that topic, but as someone who uses that topic to specialize in methodologies of computer science.

I have taken numerous courses in different fields and topics of Computer Science, both at an undergraduate and graduate level, and have been the teaching assistant for a diverse a set of computer science courses. 

While I have no work experience outside of a commercial and university environment, I am incredibly prepared to learn and adapt to new software, languages, and tools. As to my areas of interest, I aspire to design, build, and explore complex computer models, for any application area, to perform tasks of significance. Furthermore, I stress that I am a devout in good quality products as well as a firm believer in loyalty.

Education
===================

Dalhousie University; Halifax, Canada 

Master of Computer Science (Jan '14 - Apr '15)
Continued education in Advanced Data Structures, Algorithms, Heuristics, and Natural Language Processing. Written a thesis “Sampling Discrete Combinatorial Spaces in Phylogenetics” that explores a combinatorial space problem found in the field of bioinformatics. A visualization and exploration of the space and relevant heuristics are carried out. 
>> Supervised by Assoc. Prof. Christian Blouin (cblouin@cs.dal.ca).

Bachelor of Computer Science with Distinction - GPA 3.8 - Dean's List (2008 - 2014)
Focused on advanced concepts in mathematics (incl. geometry, cryptography, linear algebra) alongside a strong understanding of chemistry, biology, and philosophy. The degree also featured experience working with clients inside the community through a Community Outreach program. Extracurricular. Computer Science Graduate Society, Executive Secretary for later term of 2014; Computer Science Society, Dalhousie University, Executive Secretary as of 2012-2013; Sodales Debating Society, Dalhousie University, Executive Secretary in 2010.

Research Assistant; Software Developer, Blouin Lab (2012 - 2014)
Orchestrated work in different areas of bioinformatics. Helped construct software libraries for geometric morphometric analysis of 2D and 3D biological structures, for molecular dynamics, for protein homology modelling, and for the parsing of essential file formats. Performed a great deal of debugging and restructuring of existing code base.

Teaching Assistantship, Instr. James Fleming (2012 - 2013)
Helped in the evaluation of a class of around 75 students by marking formal oral presentations, midterm and final examinations for the Communication Skills: Oral/Written mid-undergraduate course introducing concepts associated with technical writing and presentation.
