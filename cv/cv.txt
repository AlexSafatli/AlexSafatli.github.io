===================
Summary
===================

Graduate of a Master of Computer Science program in October 2015. I have completed all of my program requirements. I am searching for employment that will allow me to grow professionally and to exercise techniques of software development and engineering.

I have taken numerous courses in different fields and topics of Computer Science, both at an undergraduate and graduate level, and have been the teaching assistant for a diverse set of computer science courses. 

I am very prepared to learn new methodologies and techniques. I aspire to design, build, and explore complex computer models. I also aspire to outgrow any duties given to me. I promise to provide maximum effort, to be open to criticism and new ideas, and to be someone you can trust to adapt and perform.

Research Assistant, Prof. Mary Anne White (Summer 2010)
Worked as a summer research assistant in the Department of Chemistry for a group focused on physical chemistry of materials, and helped write a journal article for the Ashrae 2011 Annual Conference on Solar Panels and the use of Phase Change Materials (PCMs) to store energy. A prototype was helped built for this manner of application for a local facility.

Research Assistant, Prof. Peter Wentzell (Summer 2009)
Worked as a summer research assistant in the Department of Chemistry for a group focused on chemometrics and the analysis of chemical data, and helped write a suite of software that helped in the finding of genetic motifs in DNA sequences and to evaluate statistical plots of findings.
